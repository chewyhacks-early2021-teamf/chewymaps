## What is going on?
This map is centered on New York City showing you over 500 pet friendly locations and places that you can get pet products or aid. At the top there are two filters. You can choose to filter out locations by 'Borough' or by 'Category'.

### Special interactions:
If you click on any pin, it should zoom in on that once point you clicked on. The only pin this is different for is the Manhattan Beach Dog Run, explained below.  

There is a pin that demonstrates the future pop up feature, giving information about a location. This is the Manhattan Beach Dog Run. In a full window, from the center of the map go to the bottom of the cluster of pins, on Brighton Beach. From there click on the pin to the far right of that piece of land in Manhattan Beach. That should give you a popup window with information about the Manhattan Beach Dog Run.
